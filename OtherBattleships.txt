you can easely start a match, with a few options, 1v1 to a random player, against a friend or a bot.
the design is ok, it looks a bit dated, but the the hits are easely to distinguish to misses.

the design is modern. but with that ships are white squares or rectangles, instead of ships. missed dont look like misses, the are orange square with a dot. I dont like some of the gameplay mechanics, cant place ships next to eachother. there are tomany ships, and alot of 1 square ships, making the end of the game just filling in the holes. and when you hit you can immidiatly try again, this makes it easier to win when getting lucky on the first hit
